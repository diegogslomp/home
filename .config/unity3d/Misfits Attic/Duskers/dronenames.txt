# Use at your own risk!  Some drone names may interfere with commands or introduce bugs.
# Modifying this file may require you to start a new run ([R]eset)!
#
# The following are some naming considerations:
# 	Add 1 drone name per row
# 	The first character must be a letter (a-z/A-Z)
# 	Illegal characters: ':', ',', '|', '='
# 	Names longer than 10 characters will be truncated
# 	Names cannot start with characters that may conflict with airlock, door, and room numbers (ex: myR2D2 is valid, but R2D2 is not)
#   At least 10 names are recommended to avoid frequent duplicates, ~30-40 is ideal
#   The # comments a line so do not put them on lines with the names
# 
# NAME_EX1
# NAME_EX2
